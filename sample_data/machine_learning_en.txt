Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and rewards

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

Machine learning has revolutionized many industries and continues to be a rapidly growing field.
